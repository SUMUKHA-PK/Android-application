Goals of this application is to implement all kinds of technologies I have a grip of till now and possibly create an useful application. 

It has the following technologies:
* Uses JAVA for the android application : Login activity, registration activity, creates sockets and connects to the server.
* Uses Python to host a server : Creates a server, checks whether the credentials match the existing ones in the database, connects to a MySQL database.
* MySQL : This has all the credentials of the users existing and using the application.
